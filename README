shod (or "shod2", to distinguish it from its previous version) is a
multi-monitor floating reparenting X11 window manager that supports
tiled and tabbed containers.  shod sets no keybindings, reads no
configuration, and works only via mouse with a given key modifier
(Alt by default) and by responding to client messages sent by the
shodc utility (shod's remote controller).

shod was inspired by the following programs and window managers.  I'd
like to thank their authors for their work that helped me developing
shod.

shod was developed after studying the code of the following window
managers.  I'd like to thank their authors for their work that helped
me understanding how a X Window Manager works.
