shod is a multi-monitor, floating, reparenting X11 window manager that
supports tiled and tabbed containers.  shod works via mouse with a given
key modifier (Alt by default) and by responding to client messages sent
by the shodc utility (shod's remote controller).

shod was inspired by the following programs and window managers.  I'd
like to thank their authors for their work that helped me developing
shod.

shod was developed after studying the code of the following window
managers.  I'd like to thank their authors for their work that helped
me understanding how a X Window Manager works.
