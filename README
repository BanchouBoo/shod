shod is a mouse-based X11 window manager that can tile and tab windows
inside floating containers. To tile windows, drag-and-drop the titlebar
of one window into the border of the other with the right mouse button.
The entire grid of tiles is called a "container", and can float around
on the screen.

shod works via mouse, possibly with a given modifier (Alt by default),
and by responding to client messages sent by the shodc utility (shod's
remote controller).  With the exception of the alt-tab combination for
cycling windows, shod does no keybinding by itself and relies on other
applications (such as sxhkd) for that.

shod has no default bar.  However shod has a dock where dockapps (small
windows commonly used on other window managers like Window Maker) can
be on.  The dock does not appear unless a dockapp is spawned.

shod can be customized by setting X resources.

shod was inspired by the following programs and window managers.  I'd
like to thank their authors for their work that helped me developing
shod.

shod was developed after studying the code of the following window
managers.  I'd like to thank their authors for their work that helped
me understanding how a X Window Manager works.
